Hi Randy, 
You have a few options to run this. 
I checked, you have collaborator permissions on the [repo](https://github.com/kingsukhoi/Web2Assignment2), so you can download it from there.

If you want to download [Docker](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows), 
follow the instructions above. 

Nick developed this in Windows, so I'm 98% sure it works.

If you don't, I started a GCP instance that's running this application.
